/**
 * Duck Type:
 *      - Two objects are considered the same type if they have the same structure,
 *        even if they belong to different classes.
 *      - TypeScript uses structural typing â†’ Checks property presence instead of class hierarchy.
 *      - Duck typing in action:
 *        Even though duck and parrot are different objects, they work with the Bird interface because they share the same structure
 * 
 * Phrase: 
 *      - When I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck

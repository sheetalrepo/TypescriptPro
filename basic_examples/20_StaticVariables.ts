/**
 * 
 * Prototype:
 *    - access via obj1.companyName
 *    - shared across all instances
 *          -- Use prototype for methods that operate on an instance of a class. 
 *          -- Best for object-specific logic where each instance can access shared behavior. 
 *          -- Saves memory because all instances share the same function instead of duplicating it for each object.
 * 
 * 
 * Static:
 *    - access via ClassName.companyName
 *    - attached to class itself
 *    - When to use static: 
 *          -- Use static for shared constants or utility functions that donâ€™t depend on an instance. 
 *          -- Ideal for factory methods, configuration settings, helper functions. 
 *          -- Cannot be accessed via this inside instance methods.
